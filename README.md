## Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (NSMHW) Project:
The Australian Bureau of Statistics National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (ABS_NSMHW) Project uses publicly available data from the ABS to answer the following key research questions:

1. What is the self-reported age of onset for suicidal ideation, self-harm, and attempted suicide by generational group and is the self-reported age of onset getting younger?
2. What is the relationship between self-reported chronic pain and suicidal ideation, self-harm, and attempted suicide?


### Background:
Adolescence and early adulthood have been identified as high-risk periods for the emergence of both suicidal ideation (Zagdańska et al., 2013) and self-harm (Gillies et al., 2018).
